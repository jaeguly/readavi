Read AVI - AVI Header Dumper  The AVI file format is an audio/video file "container" that can hold raw video, mjpeg, xvid, divx, and many other compressed audio and video formats. This simple little program is an example how to parse AVI files and will dump the AVI headers from a file. I found this program quite useful for debugging AVI files created by programs I wrote and for figuring out what video codecs an AVI file using.
